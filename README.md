# Magic Mirror² Timetagger

This is a [`Magic Mirror²`](https://magicmirror.builders/) module that shows the latest hours tracked by [Timetagger](https://timetagger.app).
Timetagger is a time tracking application built by Almar Klein.

Specifically, it displays the following data:
- hours worked this week
- hours worked today
- work in progress indicator (red circle)

In order to use this module, you need to have a [`Timetagger`](https://timetagger.app) account. You can also self-host Timetagger
as described in the Timetagger documentation.
